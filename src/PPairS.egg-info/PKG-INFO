# PPairS: Pairwise Preference Search with Linear Probing

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/777825592.svg)](TODO) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository implements PPairS, introduced in [**Aligning Language Model Evaluators with Human Judgement**](TODO), a dissertation submitted for the degree of *Master of Research in Environmental Data Science*.

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLM's) are capable automatic evaluators, highly suited for problems in which large datasets of text samples are evaluated on a numerical or Likert scale e.g., scoring factual accuracy or the quality of generated natural language. However, LLM's are still sensitive to prompt design and exhibit biases in such a way that their judgements may be *misaligned* with human assessments. <a href="https://github.com/cambridgeltl/PairS">Pairwise Preference Search</a> (PairS) is a search method designed to exploit LLMs' capabilities at conducting pairwise comparisons instead, in order to partially circumvent the issues with direct-scoring methods, however this approach still relies heavily on prompt design. As an alternative, we make use of concept-based interpretability methods and introduce **Pairwise Preference Search with Linear Probing** (PPairS), which further develops PairS through the construction of contrast pair embeddings and the use of linear probing to directly align an evaluator with human assessments. PPairS achieves state-of-the-art performance on text evaluation tasks and domain-specific problems of fact-checking and uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, it reduces the financial and computational constraints on automatic evaluation using LLM's, as it allows for peformance competitive with frontier, proprietary models using cheaper, smaller, open-weights models.
